Overview of the Basic Calculator Project

Project Purpose

The Basic Calculator project is designed to provide users with a simple command-line interface for performing basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal is to help users understand how to handle user input, perform calculations, and display results in Java.

Key Features

1. User Input: The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an arithmetic operation.
 
2. Arithmetic Operations: Supports four basic operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
3. Error Handling:

Checks for division by zero and informs the user appropriately.
Validates the operation input to ensure it corresponds to one of the defined operations.

4, Result Display: After performing the calculation, the program displays the result in a user-friendly format.

Project Structure

Main Class: The BasicCalculator class contains the main method, which serves as the entry point for the program.
Scanner for Input: Utilizes the Scanner class from the java.util package to read user input from the console.

User Interaction Flow

The program starts and welcomes the user.
It prompts the user to enter the first number.
It prompts the user to enter the second number.
The user is asked to choose an operation from a list of options.
Based on the selected operation, the program performs the calculation.
The program checks for any errors (e.g., division by zero).
The result is displayed to the user.
The program terminates.

               
            
Conclusion
This Basic Calculator project serves as a practical exercise in Java programming, emphasizing user input, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations. It can be further expanded to include more advanced features, such as additional mathematical functions, input validation, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience.
